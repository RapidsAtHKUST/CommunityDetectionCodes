   *  mcl-14-137 released. Fix build error under clang.


Fri May 16 2014

   *  mcl-14-136 released.

   *  mcl can subcluster a given clustering. This is achieved by supplying
      the latter as argument to the new -icl option. Edges in the input
      graph that cross clusters will be removed before using the MCL cluster
      algorithm to compute the subclustering.

   *  clm vol can compute node volatility by comparing one set of clusterings
      against another set of clusterings (rather than comparing all against all).
      This is achieved by inserting a "--" separator in the list of filenames.
      The set of clusterings in the files with names to the left are compared
      to those with names to the right of the separator.

   *  clm dist obeys the same convention as clm vol above. That is, if
      a separator "--" is present in the list of filenames, than all
      clusterings specified to the left are compared with all clusterings
      specified to the right.

   *  The mcx query interface has been made less idiosyncratic. Edge weights
      attributes and summary statistics are no longer scaled.

   *  mcx ctty can now also compute edge centrality betweenness (--edge
      option). It can be parallelised using threading across multiple CPUs
      (with -t) and by using multiple machines (with -j and -J).

   *  clm has a new mode 'optics'. It does everything that the OPTICS
      algorithm does short of actually producing a clustering.

      -  It outputs the ordered reachability scores. (coredistance)

      -  It can output the OPTICS landscape visualisation.

      -  It can visualise a given clustering (for example
         one derived by MCL) in the OPTICS landscape by colouring
         bars according to asssociated node cluster membership.

   *  Several programs have acquired the --write-binary option
      to enable native binary formatted output.

   *  A graph can be subselected such that only the edges consistent with a clustering are retained:

         mcx alter -imx NETWORKFILE -icl CLUSTERFILE --block

      The edges that are not consistent with a clustering can be selected by
      using the --blockc option instead.

   *  mcxload can now read binary format with the options
         -packed <fname>
         -pack-cnum <num>
         -pack-rnum <num>

      The scripts/ directory contains an example script packed-example.sh
      documenting (by example C code) the binary input accepted by mcxload.

   *  mcx query can output degree histogram data with -hist-degrees <step>.

   *  mcxrand can now shuffle clusterings. It reads a given clustering
      with the -icl option and outputs a clustering that preserves the cluster sizes
      with nodes randomly redistributed.

   *  mcxrand can generate graphs using preferential attachment with -pa V/m
      to create a graph with V nodes, m edges added at each step.

   *  mcxarray has several new options:

      --angle-norm            normalised to [0, 1].
      --acute-angle-norm      normalised to [0, 1].
      --slow-cosine           cosine(0.5 * phi)
                                 correlated 1, anti-correlated 0
      --slow-sine             sine(0.5 * phi)
                                 correlated 1, anti-correlated 0
      --taxi                  sum | xi - yi |
      --max                   max | xi - yi |
      --euclid                Euclidean distance
      -minkowski <num>        Minkowski distance with power <num>

   *  Fixed bug in mcxdump -imx-tree; the case where trees were encoded
      as a stack of flattened clusterings was not treated correctly.

   *  clm info2 is a new mode to clm. It is a streamlined update of clm info
      that either outputs the efficiency for all nodes in a network relative
      to a given clustering (with the --list option), or the average  accross
      all nodes.
      It can be parallelised using threads and job dispatching using the
      customary -t <threads> -j <jid> -J <jnum> options also shared by
      mcxarray, mcx diameter, mcx ctty, and mcx clcf.

   *  mcxdump can now transform objects before outputting them (-tf option).

   *  mcxi has a new 'threads' primitive to set the number of threads.

   *  The environment variable MCLEDGE_NCPUS is now interpreted by various
      programs in mcl-edge. For certain compute-intensive tasks they will
      split the work into this many different threads of computation.


Mon May 21 2012

   *  mcl-12-135 released.

   *  mcx ctty was sped up by trimming the implementation of Brandes' algorithm.

   *  A new transform was added: #n(). Use e.g. as #n(20). This takes the
      top N (20 in this cases) neighbours for each node by edge (arc) weight.
      All selected arcs will be converted to (bidirectional) edges.
      The existing #knn() transform has an identical selection stage, but then removes
      all arcs for which the reciprocal arc was not selected.

   *  mcx query has a new mode -vary-n utilising the nearest neighbour transform
      described above.

   *  mcl did not treat -t and -te (thread options) correctly when the number of
      threads specified was larger than 64, and would crash. Fixed. mcl now
      accepts any number of threads up to 65536.

Thu, 8 Mar 2012

   *  mcl-12-068 released.

   *  Stopgap release to fix a segmentation fault. Triggered in abc mode
      due to absent initialisation of new SIF functionality. Now fixed.

   *  mcxrand has a new -pa <V>/<m> mode. This uses the standard preferential attachment
      model to randomly generate a scale-free network.

Wed, 7 Dec 2011

   *  mcl-11-335 released.

   *  For a long time now MCL has shipped with many siblings in what is intended to
      be a coherent set of network analysis tools. What this collection has lacked is
      some way of refering to it without creating confusion. This void is now filled,
      and MCL-edge is the new name. The unadorned name MCL will not go away, and the
      source code will still be shipped using a name of the format mcl-YY-DDD.

   *  mcxload can now read SIF (Simple Interaction File) format with -sif <filename>.
      The second column (relationship type) is ignored. To ensure
      that an undirected graph is read, use the --stream-mirror option.

   *  mcxdump can now output SIF format with -dump-sif <relationship-type>.
      The argument indicates the, yes, relationship type.

   *  mcl can now read SIF format with the --sif option.
      With this option, the input file is assumed to be in SIF format.

   *  mcl can now read etc format with the --etc option.  This is similar to
      SIF format except that the second column, identifying the relationship
      type, is dropped.

   *  mcx query now can read label format in its default mode. Not yet
      in other modes.

   *  'efficiency' criterion added to mcx query -vary-threshold,
      -vary-knn, et cetera.

   *  minor fix in clm enstrict; on some occassions it would not clean up
      empty clusters left by the removal of overlap.

Fri, 20 Jul 2010

   *  mcl-10-201 released.

   *  The speed of the clustering program mcl was improved.
      It now utilises vanilla matrix/vector multiplication where this is faster
      than sparse matrix/vector multiplication. It chooses between an
      O(k^2 + N) algorithm with very low hidden constant and an O(k^2) algorithm
      with significantly higher hidden constant, using the algorithm with least
      expected run-time.  Here k is a constant that bounds the number of
      resources allocated to a node in the graph.

   *  The speed optimization code acquired a more logical option for adjustment
      (-sparse) with a sane default setting that should work satisfactorily
      across a wide range of graphs.

   *  The memory management code for vectors and sets was improved to work
      better under malloc implementations that do not cope well with high
      memory churn and large shrinking realloc requests.

   *  mcx query acquired --edges, --edges-sorted, and -edges-hist options.
      They respectively output an unsorted list, sorted list, and histogram of
      edge weights. Despite 'edges' being part of the names of these option,
      the output contains a weight for each arc. For undirected graphs each
      edge will be represented twice.

   *  mcx query acquired --output-table option. With -vary-threshold or
      --vary-correlation the output will be a tab-separated table with row
      names and without key.

   *  Got rid of the version tag (i.e. 1.008). It never acquired any meaning.

   *  Documentation was fixed and upated.


Fri, 28 May 2010

   *  mcl-10-148 released.

   *  mcl has become faster. It chooses between different matrix/vector multiplication
      algorithms depending on the sparsity level of the vector.

   *  mcx erdos now works for directed graph, requiring the option --is-directed.

   *  clm adjust has a new option --force-connected. If
      the input clustering does not induce connected subgraphs a subclustering
      is output that does have that property.

   *  mcx clcf has been parallelized and now accepts -t <num> option.

   *  All -knn and -ceil-nb command line options are gone. The functionality
      is still available in a more general fashion as new modes to the -tf
      transformation option. As an example, '-knn 40' is now specified as -tf
      '#knn(40)'. This is more general since the k-NN transformation
      can be one among a list of transformations, where the user is
      free to choose and order.

   *  All -tf style options allow new modes:

         #max()      make a graph symmetric using max
         #min()      make a graph symmetric using min
         #add()      make a graph symmetric using add
         #arcmax()   reduce two arcs to one arc using max
         $arcsub()   compute G[->] - G[<-]
         #arcmcl(<num>) cluster a directed graph with inflation <num>
         #tug()      perturb edge weights to break ties (uses neighbourhood information)
         #shrug()    perturb edge weights to break ties (randomly)
         #mcl(<num>)    cluster an undirected graph with inflation <num>
         #knn(<num>)    reduce graph using k-Nearest-Neighbour selection
         #ceilnb(<num>) reduce graph using ceil-nb selection
         #tp()       replace graph/matrix by inverse relationship
         #step(<num>)  replace graph by <num>-step relation
         #thread()   set thread count for parallelizable transformations (e.g. #knn)

      Modes that start with the octothorpe (#) operate on entire graphs/matrices.
      Other modes, e.g. ceil(), lt(), add(), operate on edges.

   *  A bug in clm enstrict was removed.

   *  clm dist has a new mode --index, in which it outputs the Rand index,
      the adjusted (Hubert Arabie) Rand index, and the Jaccard index.

   *  Esoteric options and logging code were removed from mcl, to improve
      readability and maintainability of its source.

   *  mcx clcf, mcx diameter, and mcx ctty all output column headers.
      mcx collect by default expects column headers.
      mcx --paste concatenates rows from different tables, requiring that the
      first column is identical.

   *  mcx query --node-attr outputs a table of network node attributes.

   *  mcx diameter, mcx ctty, mcx clcf, and mcxarray all accept the same parallelization
      interface. Jobs can split over multiple threads as well as over
      multiple machines. The latter is done by the concept of 'thread group'.

      -  Use -t to specify the number of threads.
            mcxarray -t 4 
         will run with 4 threads.

      -  Use -J to specify the number of groups/machines to use,
         use -j to specify the group index.

         It is important that all jobs use the same -t value, as all jobs
         assume all other jobs use the same number while figuring out which
         tasks they should run.  The collection of tasks will only be
         consistent if the jobs work from the same number of threads and
         the same number of groups.
         
         In the future different jobs will be able to run different numbers of
         threads by having multiple group IDs.

         mcxarray:
            machine 1:  mcxarray -t 3 -J 4 -j 0 -o d0.cor 
            machine 2:  mcxarray -t 3 -J 4 -j 1 -o d1.cor 
            machine 3:  mcxarray -t 3 -J 4 -j 2 -o d2.cor 
            machine 4:  mcxarray -t 3 -J 4 -j 3 -o d3.cor 

            mcx collect -o result.cor d0.cor d1.cor d2.cor d3.cor 

         This last command combines the partial results and writes
         to the file called result.cor .

         mcx diameter/ctty:
            machine 1:  mcx diameter -t 8 -J 4 -j 0 -o d0.diam
            machine 2:  mcx diameter -t 8 -J 4 -j 1 -o d1.diam
            machine 3:  mcx diameter -t 8 -J 4 -j 2 -o d2.diam
            machine 4:  mcx diameter -t 8 -J 4 -j 3 -o d3.diam

            mcx collect --two-column -o result.diameter d0.diam d1.diam d2.diam d3.diam

      -  The previous -start and -end options to mcx ctty and mcx diameter
         have been removed.

      -  By default mcx collect expects matrix arguments. The two-column output
         generated by mcx diameter/ctty should be specified using the
         mcx collect --two-column option.

   *  mcxarray has seen many changes and improvements.

      -  It can use multiple cores. It uses pthreads and accepts the option -t
         <num> to specify that <num> threads/cores should be used.

      -  It only accepts tab characters as separators. Spaces
         no longer work.

      -  Parse errors are pinpointed precisely within the input file.

      -  It can handle missing data. Missing data is introduced
         either by 'NA' or 'NaN' or 'inf' values in the tabular data, or by an
         empty column. When computing correlations, rows are only compared on
         those positions where neither of them has missing data.

      -  It has a new option --zero-as-na. With this, zeroes are treated
         as NA (not available/applicable), and during the calculation of
         correlations vectors are only considered on positions where neither is
         NA.  This works for modes --pearson (default) and --spearman.  This
         mode has very specialized uses. One example is when the input is
         constructed using mcxload and read in mcxarray with -imx.  In this
         case missing data cannot be specified as 'NA' or empty columns, so
         other means are necessary.

   *  clm order should write an output tree in its default mode,
      but it did not. Now fixed.

   *  mcxdump --dump-table would err for graphs with sparse domains.  Now fixed.

   *  mcx query has mode -vary-knn, to analyse different levels of
      knn-selection (k-Nearest-Neighbours).

   *  Code clean-up: the taurus library for integer set manipulation
      was finally discarded.

   *  A bug in the mcxi max and min operators was fixed, and both max and min
      can now operate on matrices.


Wed, 04 Nov 2009

   *  mcl-09-308 released.

   *  The mcl cluster interpretation function did not deal correctly with
      graphs that were encoded in gappy representations. Fixed.  This would not
      have been an issue for normal mcl usage, as mcl itself never constructs
      such graphs (e.g. from label input).

   *  The 'q' mode to mcx (invoked as 'mcx q') has been renamed as 'mcx query'.
      The new mode --vary-correlation triggers analysis of a correlation graph
      at a series of thresholds, e.g. the number of connected components,
      statistics (median, average, iqr) on node degrees and edge weights,
      and a graph plotting the log(k) / log(#nodes of degree >=k) R^2 value
      (high for scale-free-ish networks).

   *  mcl has had many not-so-interesting options removed or hidden.

   *  mcl has a new option, -knn-mutual <num>.
      This considers the <num> best neighbours for each node, then only keeps
      edges that occur in both best-neighbour lists for the two incident nodes.

   *  clm has a new mode 'stable', which outputs a (possibly overlapping) clustering
      derived from a set of input clusterings. Each output cluster has a
      stability value associated with it. If it is high, it means that
      the output cluster occurred in some form in many of the input clusterings.
      Such a matrix can be dumped with inclusion of the stability score
      using the mcxdump option --dump-vlines.

   *  clm dist has new option --chain and --sort. The first causes only
      consecutive comparisons to be made, the second sorts the clusterings
      in order of (descending) granularity.

   *  If automatic naming of output files is employed (by not using the -o
      option), mcl will only use the trailing part of the input file name.
      Output will accordingly be written in the current directory, rather than
      the directory in which the input file resides, as was previously the
      case.  The latter behaviour can be obtained by using the new unary --d
      option.

   *  clm order and mcxarray have received polishing and upgrades.
      -  mcxarray now preserves negative correlations and
      makes them available for later transformation (i.e. either
      discarding or absolute value replacement).
      -  clm order finally outputs sensible output, namely a clustering
      ordered in a manner consistent with the received set of nesting
      clusterings, with largest clusters first, recursively,
      starting from the coarsest clustering. It is possible to
      halt this procedure at any level in the hierarchy using
      the new -level option.
      -  clm order used to accept just a cluster hierarchy (such as produced
      by mclcm or simple concatenating of cluster files). It now accepts
      multiple separate clusterings as well, and one can even mix hierarchies
      and clusterings all at the same time.

   *  The mcxplotlines.R script shipped with mcl has been improved and can
      display a coarse experiment ordering (derived from clustering experiments
      rather than probes) such as provided by 'clm order' on the expression
      plots. The script should be regarded as a template for further
      customization, although it does accept a number of parameters.

      The expression plots now plot expression for all probes in a given
      cluster, as well as the median value of expression of all probes
      across a given experiment.

      It is possible to let mcxplotlines.R handle a secondary coarser
      clustering encoded by 'clm order'. The script will group together
      information for the clusters within each supercluster, and plot
      the medians of expression for all the subclusters as well as the
      median of expression across the supercluster.

   *  mcx alter and mcxarray have both acquired the -tf option common in
      several other programs. Use this option to transform values; e.g.

         mcxarray -data t.expr -co 0.7 -tf 'abs(),add(-0.7)' -o t.mci

      takes expression data, computes the pearson correlation coefficient,
      takes values >= 0.7 and <= -0.7, takes the absolute value,
      and maps the interval [0.7-1.0] to [0-0.3].

   *  The mcl options --adapt-smooth and --adapt-local have been turned
      to no-ops.  The implementation of these experimental options was not
      sufficiently supported and not sufficiently elegant.

   *  Fixed a bug in mcxload, where mcxload -etc-ai would consistently crash.

Fri, 18 Sep 2009

   *  mcl-09-261 released.

   *  And a bug it did have (cf entry Wed 12 Jul 2009). When a resulting
      clustering contains overlap, mcl tries to split off the overlapping part.
      However, since the last release it has been doing this in a botched way,
      causing erratic results. Bug reported by Tao Yue, now fixed.

   *  The mcxarray --transpose option now transposes the input data matrix,
      rather than the result matrix, and -write-tab finds and writes the
      correct labels in the presence of --transpose.  Bugs were reported by
      Jose Afonso Guerra Assuncao.  The mcxarray --teartp option has been
      removed.

   *  Added -resource <num> flag to mcl. Throughout the process, each
      node will only keep track of at most <num> neighbours.
      Use -ceil-nb <num> if you want to reduce the input graph in
      the same manner.


Wed, 12 Jul 2009

   *  mcl-09-182 released.

   *  Lint modes have been removed from mcl. Linting can now be achieved
      using 'clm adjust'.

   *  Analysis modes (and lint modes, now removed) would crash when combined
      with --abc.  Bug reported by David MacIver, now fixed.

   *  The interpretation routines were rewritten to be more compact and at a
      somewhat higher-level of expressiveness, and should accordingly be
      more understandable, maintainable, and extensible. They might have new
      bugs too.

   *  mcl and 'mcx alter' and 'mcx erdos' have acquired the option -ceil-nb
      to remove edges of lowest weight from highly connected nodes.

   *  volatility measures reported by 'clm dist' were wrong. Fixed.

   *  changed clm dist output to key=value format.

   *  'mcx erdos' can now read label input with the -abc <fname> option.

   *  Added -ceil-nb <num> (cap neighbours) option to remove edges with
      lowest weight from nodes with more than <num> edges.  Consider it a poor
      man's hub removal. Edges are removed in both directions, starting with
      nodes that have the most neighbours and going down the list.  This option
      should help in obtaining more balanced clusterings.  It reduces the
      impact of sticky (having many neighbours) nodes, which generally have the
      effect of pulling in many nodes, contributing to large clusters.
      Breaking up those clusters otherwise requires increased inflation, which
      increases cluster granularity throughout the entire graph.  The -ceil-nb
      option encodes a localized approach that should take the stick out of
      sticky nodes.

   *  The output format of 'mcx erdos' was streamlined to some extent.
      It is now in a pseudo s-expression syntax.  mcx erdos can also read label
      input with the customary -abc option.  In interactive mode it is possible
      to transform a graph in various ways, and additionally, to reread the
      graph from file.

   *  Option -pp <num> (simple pre-pruning mode) has been removed seeing
      that -ceil-nb should do a better job.

   *  mcx has a new mode, 'alter'. Currently supports -ceil-nb similar as
      above.

Fri, 07 Nov 2008

   *  mcl-08-312 released (fixes bug in mcxdeblast).

   *  Fixed a bug in mcxdeblast, reported by Zhenxiang Xi.

   *  clm and mcx have acquired a help mode, for example
         clm help info
      will invoke the manual page for the info mode. It is fully equivalent to
      'man clminfo'. All the modes that have a manual page are listed if mcx or
      clm is invoked without arguments.  This does require that the manual
      pages are installed either in a directory listed in MANPATH or in
      a standard location known to the 'man' program.

   *  Both mcx ctty (betweenness centrality) and mcx diameter can be run in
      multiple threads with the -t option.  In addition, the computation can
      be split among different machines (each machine optionally running
      multiple threads). The correct result is obtained by adding the partial
      results of all the distributed runs, using 'mcx collect' (for diameter
      subsequently, the maximum has to be taken over the resulting values).
      This implies that mcx ctty and mcx diameter can now be sped up
      arbitrarily by increasing the computation resources. Example:

      HOST1:  mcx ctty -imx graph.mci -t 4 -start 0 -end 1000 > graph.ctty1
      HOST2:  mcx ctty -imx graph.mci -t 4 -start 1000 -end 2000 > graph.ctty2
      HOST3:  mcx ctty -imx graph.mci -t 4 -start 2000 -end 3000 > graph.ctty3
      HOST4:  mcx ctty -imx graph.mci -t 4 -start 3000 -end 4000 > graph.ctty4

      mcx collect graph.ctty1 graph.ctty2 graph.ctty3 graph.ctty3 > graph.CTTY

   *  clm close has new modes of output: The number of components,
      and the list of component sizes.

   *  clm close accepts label type input with the -abc option
      similar to mcx diameter, mcx ctty, mcx clcf and others.

   *  Added reference to Ulrik Brandes' paper on centrality betweenness
      update algorithm.

   *  fixed bug in mcxdump that causes --dump-upper, --dump-upperi, --dump-lower,
      and --dump-loweri to be ignored.

   *  A small R script called mcxplotlines.R was added to the scripts
      directory. Use it to visualize per-cluster expression profiles
      for clusterings of networks derived from expression data.

   *  mcxdump in newick mode has a modality to output singleton
      labels without enclosing parentheses; -newick S.

   *  The layer responsible for handling label input (including
      the format where each line consists of LABEL1 LABEL2 WEIGHT) was
      rewritten. It is now in a more maintainable state, although
      work still needs to be done.

   *  mcl-08-057 released.

      -  mcxarray reads in gene expression data in table format and
         converts it to an mcl input graph.

      -  mcl now uses a simplified way of adding loops to the input graph. The
         loop edge weight for a node is now set to the maximum of the weights
         of edges connecting the node to its neighbours.  This may cause small
         changes in clustering results. These changes should generally be of
         the same (small) magnitude as changes resulting from perturbing the
         input data (edge weights).

      -  Added a program to compute, in various modes, for each node its
         clustering coefficient, its eccentricity, and its betweenness
         centrality. Also, to compute the diameter of a graph (i.e. the
         maximum eccentricity): mcx clcf, mcx diameter, and mcx ctty.

      -  The number of applications has decreased substantially.
         See below.

      -  The mcl suite is moving towards a wider focus on general purpose
         large scale graph utilities, with the emphasis so far on basic
         measures and transformations.

         *  mcx diameter   compute diameter
         *  mcx ctty       compute centrality
         *  mcx clcf       compute clustering coefficient
         *  mcx erdos      compute shortest paths
         *  mcxrand        randomly shuffle, add, create, perturb edges
         *  mclcm          hierarchical clustering with mcl
         *  clm dist       compute cluster distance
         *  clm meet       compute maximal joint subclustering
         *  clm close      compute (subgraph) connected components
         *  ...            and more.

         *  mcxi (formerly mcx) basic matrix operations

         The binaries installed are

         mcl         mcxarray       mcxrand     clmformat
         mclcm       mcxassemble    mcxsubs
         clm         mcxdump
         mcx         mcxload
         mcxi        mcxmap

         The scripts installed are mclpipeline, along with mcxdeblast and
         mclblastline if configure was instructed with --enable-blast.

         Currently all programs in the mcl suite use one of the three
         prefixes "mcl", "mcx", or "clm".

      -  first basic support for tree structures in the library.
      -  new --shadow-vl mcl preprocessing option.
      -  new mcl logging framework.

      -  speed ups in many applications.
      -  binary format can now be streamed over STDOUT/STDIN.

   *  Added mclcm, which implements hierarchical clustering with mcl.
      It supports several modes:

         contraction    progress from fine to coarse
         subcluster     progress from coarse to fine
         dispatch       compute and combine different

   *  The mcl option --shadow-vl aids in creating well-balanced hierarchies
      by adding dummy (shadow) nodes to a graph, which throttles flow between
      denser and sparser parts. This prevents rapid absorption of sparse parts
      by dense parts.
      Possibly useful in standalone mode as well.

   *  New experimental mcl options --adapt-local and --adapt-smooth.  They
      adapt inflation according to local density characteristics of the input
      graph.

   *  The number of applications has decreased substantially.

      Most of the clm**** applications are now dispatched by the new
      program clm, and most of the mcx**** applications are now dispatched
      by the program mcx:

      clm MODE       clm encapsulates
                        dist order vol mate meet imac info close residue

      mcx MODE       mcx encapsulates
                        convert clcf diameter

      Use
         clm dist [options] <files>
         clm order [options] <files>
         mcx convert [options] <files>
      et cetera.

      The functionality formerly in mcx is now offered by mcxi.

   *  Interchange format now uses scientific notation except within a
      limited range around zero (by using the fprintf %g conversion
      specifier). This makes interchange format less lossy.

   *  binary format can now be streamed over STDOUT/STDIN. implying
      very fast and lossless communication between mcl programs.  Binary
      format is lossless compared to interchange format in that the text
      representations used by the latter are currently not garantueed to
      result in the exact same value when read back.

   *  Lots of optimization work on graph and set related operations.
      Many operations have been sped up for canonical matrices.  These speed
      ups do not affect mcl itself.  Sped up: clmclose.

   *  mcl verbosity output is now largely controlled by a new logging
      framework. Use the -q option or set environment variable TINGEA_LOG_TAG.
      Use -q x -V all to thoroughly silence mcl.

   *  mcl emits more graph and cluster-related quantities in its
      progress/log output.

   *  mcxarray:
      It can now read flat-file array files with the -data option.
      +  Skipping leading rows and leading columns is supported
         (-skipr/-skipc).  missing data is not yet supported.
      +  Labels can be written to a tab file

   *  Renamed -cache-graph, -cache-graphx, -cache-tab to -write-graph,
      -write-graphx, -write-tab. This is to avoid terminological confusion
      with the process-level caching sometimes employed by mcl within a single
      run to accomodate postprocessing.

      Similarly the mcxload -cache-xxx options were all renamed to -write-xxx.

   *  mcl is accessible as a C library call. It is very undocumented
      and lacking is an interface to build up a matrix.  There are not yet
      convenient installation tools.

   *  mcxdump by default read from STDIN and -imx is no longer
      required.

   *  Fixed bug in mcxassemble where it would crash when presented
      with a corrupted format.

   *  Added -lint-k and -lint-l options. Either will reread the input matrix and 
      do postprocessing on the clustering, reallocating nodes that seem to
      have siphoned the wrong way.

      When applied to networks with inhomogenously distributed edge density
      characteristics the mcl process will sometimes cause smaller
      clusters/sparse areas to suck in border nodes which 1) have only few
      edges to that cluster/area and 2) seem to have been sucked out of a much
      denser cluster into which they would fit beautifully. This is fully in
      line with the flow characteristics of mcl but a largely unwanted
      phenomenon.  The postprocessing steps were added to remedy this.

      -lint-l <num> considers all nodes in clusters of size not exceeding
      <num> and optionally moves them to a larger cluster. Each
      node is considered separately.

      -lint-k <num> will try to have small clusters (up to a given size k)
      assimilated in their entirety by a larger cluster if a suitable suitor
      can be found.

   *  Fixed bug in mcxload -etc -etc-ai functionality. Singletons
      would cause mayhem.

   *  The code underlying the analysis framework was largely reimplemented
      and reorganized.

   *  --keep-overlap=y/n was removed and replaced by -overlap
      <keep|remove|split>, remove being the default as before.
      The split mode is new and causes all maximally consistent
      overlapping fragments to be put in new clusters. This mode
      is used in mclcm to cover theoretical fringe cases.

   *  If label data is tab-separated labels may contain spaces.
      The code switches to tab-separated values if it finds a tab
      in the input.

   *  Fixed bug in label loading where transformed values set to zero
      were kept.

   *  Changed default output format in clminfo.

   *  GRATUITOUS. Bumped the gratuitous version tag to 1.007.

Mon, 27 Feb 2006

   *  mcl-06-058 released.

   *  Added scripts/minimcl, a 200-line fully functional mcl
      implementation in perl. It only accepts label input and
      has no parameters except inflation. The implementation is
      hash-based rather than array, which may or may not leverage
      sparseness properties.

Sat, 21 Jan 2006

   *  mcl-06-021 released.

   *  This release flushes some work before embarking on a big
      mcxsubs overwrite. Analysis and cache modes have been improved.

   *  mcxsubs excepts path(<index-list>) top-level spec. It sets
      the domain to all nodes participating in all shortest path
      between all members of (the comma-separated) <index-list>.

   *  mcxsubs now works by default on the nil matrix. This makes it
      easy to create domain templates with mcxsubs, e.g.

         mcxsubs 'dom(cr, i(2,3,4))'

      creates an empty matrix on the specified domains.

   *  mcxsubs did not recognize --from-disk and 'ext(disc())' specifications
      cannot be combined and would dereference a NULL pointer. Fixed.

   *  Fixed weed-related bug in mcxsubs (removing rows/columns).

   *  Cleaned up the postprocess/analysis/caching frameworks.
      Exceptions, limitations, and user-second-guessing were removed.  By
      default mcl does not append the log (it used to do this *sometimes*).

   *  Analysis modes try to read a cached graph if it exists.

   *  Added -cache-graphx <fname>. This caches a graph after transformations
      have been applied.

   *  Caching of the input graphs is now done before matrix transformations
      have been applied, but necessarily after stream transformations (if any)
      have been applied in case input is streamed. 

   *  Added -etc option to mcxload to load simple graphs from label-data
      in a line-based format.
      Use -etc-ai to load matrices for which the column labels are not
      specified (e.g. clusterings). mcxload will autoincrement the columns.

   *  Fixed some documentation errors; inserted -abc-tf, --abc-log and
      --abc-neg-log where -stream-tf, --stream-log and --stream-neg-log were
      erroneously used.

   *  Added rand(<pbb-keep>) transformation (the -tf and -abc-tf options).
      Selects each matrix entry with probability <pbb-keep>.

   *  mcl now prints a helpful reminder to cite the appropriate reference.

   *  Added configure-time check for
         void* val = (void*) unsigned_number
      idiom used by the stream interface.

Thu 17 Nov 2005

   *  mcl-05-321 released.

   *  Focus: uniform transformation syntax accross programs, improved
      documentation, especially mcxio. Previous 'ascii' format is now called
      interchange format throughout the documentation.

   *  mcl accepts the -abc-tf option to transform the input stream
      and the -tf option to transform the input matrix (either constructed
      from a stream with --abc or directly read from a stream).

      -abc-tf 'pow(2), ceil(200), gt(20)'

      This squares everything in the input stream, then truncates everything
      larger than 200 to 200, and removes anything less than or equal to 20.
      There are two special transform cases that appear as separate options.

      --abc-log
      --abc-neg-log

      indicate that as the first thing to do the log or negative logarirthm
      should be taken. The reason is that probability scores can get quite low
      and are best represented as doubles (64 bit values); however mcl's
      internal floating point representation is by default float (32 bit
      values).

      This means that blast clustering can be done from columnar format
      like this:

      grep -v '^#' hsfsp.cblast |\
         cut -f 1,2,11  |\
         mcl - --abc --abc-neg-log -tf 'ceil(460), gt(10)'  -o -

      This will make a few people very happy, and bewilder the rest.

      For sake of completeness, ceil(460) because 1e-200 (standard
      BLAST p-value cut-off) corresponds to 1/e/-460.517019 where
      /e/ is the REAL e, namely 2.718281828.

   *  All of
      -  mcxsubs 'val(<spec>)'
      -  mcl -tf <spec>, -abc-tf <spec>
      -  mcxload -tf <spec>, -stream-tf <spec>
      -  mcxassemble -raw-tf <spec> -prm-tf <spec> -sym-tf <spec>

         now accept the same syntax, documented in mcxio(5).

   *  The mcxio manual has gained two sections, one on transformation
      syntax, one on label input.

   *  mcl -cache-graph saves the graph after any transformations have
      been applied to it.

   *  Throughout the documentation, environment variables, and
      logging statements, replaced 'ascii' by 'interchange'.
      MCLXIOASCIIDIGITS is now MCLXIOINTERCHANGEDIGITS. bliss.
      There is still plenty-o-ascii in the ChangeLog below.

Fri, 11 Nov 2005

   *  mcl-05-314 released - major new features.

   *  GRATUITOUS. Bumped the gratuitous version tag to 1.006 - because of
      mcl's new label input munging abilities.

   *  mcl can read label input.

         mcl <fname> --abc [options]

      will read a line based white-space separated label format:
         label1 label2 [value]

      The current default is to resolve repeated entries by taking the maximum
      of the values.

      --abc or --expect-abc
         input is expected to be in label format.

      --abc or --yield-abc
         cluster output will be done with labels.

      -cache-tab <fname> (assumes label input)
         the name of the file mcl writes the tab file too.

      -cache-graph <fname> (assumes label input)
         the name of the file mcl writes the input matrix.

      -strict-tab <fname> (assumes label input)
         makes MCL use the named tab file and die if labels
         are not found.

      -restrict-tab <fname> (assumes label input)
         makes MCL use the named tab file and warn if labels
         are not found.

      -extend-tab <fname> (assumes label input)
         makes MCL use the named tab file and extend it if labels
         are not found.

   *  new utility mcxload with many custom options for reading in
      label data and transforming the associated numerical values,
      storing mappings in tab files and saving a graph in native mcl
      input format.

   *  mcxdeblast acquired --abc-out to stream label input into mcl.

Thu 27 Oct 2005

   *  mcl-05-300 released.

   *  Added Q+A in FAQ on how to get application data into MCL format.

   *  Changed mcxassemble to pick the maximum between repeated entries
      by default.

   *  clmmate was changed to do something reasonable when presented with
      overlapping clusterings.

   *  Changed mcxdeblast to put the tab file in occurrence order by default.

   *  Fixed mcxsubs bug, introduced in last release, where selections never
      materialize unless one mysteriously specifies --rand-merge.

   *  mcxsubs acquired the ext(dist(k)) spec option, where k is a number.
      It applies to graphs and tells to extend the graph on the current
      specification by including neighbours reachable in at most k steps.

      ext(cdisc(k)) and ext(rdisc(k)) exist as well.

      For example, the spec

         'dom(cr, i(0-5)), ext(disc(2)), out(-)'

      first takes the nodes 0-5 and then adds all nodes reachable
      in at most 2 steps.

   *  mcxsubs can now also read a domain from a tab file.
      use -tab <fname> with t() in the dom spec, e.g. dom(cr, i(0-5), t()).

      mcxsubs -imx small.mci -dfac 0.8 'out(-)'

      will now randomly select about 80 percent of the domains.

   *  mcxdump acquired the -sep-lead option to change the col-rowlist
      separator. The -sep option was renamed to -sep-field.

   *  mcxdump can now also be used to restrict tab files.
   
      mcxdump -imx matrix-file -tab tab-file --dump-tabc
      mcxdump -imx matrix-file -tab tab-file --dump-tabr

      The first will output the restriction of the input tab file
      to the matrix column domain.
      The second will do the same for the row domain.

Thu, 29 Sep 2005

   *  mcl-05-272 released

   *  sanitized clmimac, its analysis mode for detecting DAG structure in
      iterands is now functional.

   *  mcl now accepts '-dump lines' to dump simple line-based pairs format.
      With '-dump cat' it will dump all items to the same stream. The name for
      the stream is then taken as the argument to the -o option, rather than
      derived from '-ds dump-stem' option.

      The -dump option now will simply look for substring occurrences
      of its known targets in the argument string. An example is the
      incarnation below.

         -dump ite,lines,cat -o - -di all

      will dump all iterands and the result clustering to stdout
      in a line based format.

   *  fixed bug in mcxassemble/impala; mclsMap{Cols,Rows} would
      not work due to wrongly set mclpAR->n_ivps.

   *  moved dump code from mcxdump to IO library.

   *  In clmdist and its manual page, replaced erroneous mention of Jacquard
      index by Mirkin metric or edge hamming distance.

   *  mcl would not correctly read vectors specified in multiple places,
      now fixed.

   *  mclblastline has changed.
      By default it now only creates a line-based tab-separated dump file.
      This means that by default it is not necessary to have zoem installed.
      zoem *will* be invoked when the --fmt-fancy option is supplied.

   *  mcxdeblast can read from STDIN by setting the filename to '-'.

   *  mcxdeblasts now acts on --score=r as the documentation promises.

   *  clmformat now accepts the --fancy option on top of the
      -dump <fname> option: it will do fancy output as well as dump output.

   *  clmformat will no longer by default output performance measures in dump
      mode. Use --dump-measures to obtain them.

   *  added grok option to clxdo, to obtain clmformat's node stickiness
      and cluster cohesion matrices.

   *  mcl accepts the --unchecked option, after which it will omit
      consistency checks on the input matrix. See below.

   *  Setting the environment variable
         MCLXIOUNCHECKED
      causes consistency checks to be skipped during matrix input read.
      This will speed up applications, but they will likely crash
      when confronted with nonconforming input. Only use with very
      large matrices in binary format and when in a hurry.

   *  added scripts/perllib/mcl/matrix.pm for reading/writing/manipulating
      matrices from perl. It's simple and will not expand into something grand.

Thu, 28 Apr 2005

   *  mcl-05-118 released

   *  fixed matrix read speed problem. Reading a matrix went from
      O(N^2) to O(E) where E is the number of edges (and N the number
      of nodes).

   *  mcxassemble accepts --write-binary option to force binary format.

   *  mcxdump now accepts --no-loops and --force-loops options.

   *  Tweaked binary matrix read routine a bit - optimized full reads.

   *  GRATUITOUS. Bumped the gratuitous version tag to 1.005 - because of the
      input read speed up.

Wed, 6 Apr 2005

   *  mcl-05-096 released

   *  [Joost] added clmorder.azm

   *  Updated mclfamily and mclindex documentation to mention
      clmclose and clmorder.

Thu, 31 Mar 2005

   *  mcl-05-090 released.

   *  Added options to MCL for dumping submatrices during
      iteration. Submatrices are, for now, extended principals, that
      is, all matrix entries for which either the row or the column
      index hits the specified domain.

         -dump-subi <spec>    Specify simple index list
         -dump-subd <spec>    Specify index list via union of domains
         -dump-dom <mx>       Domain matrix file

   *  Added --abc option to mcxdeblast for per-line ID1 ID2 SCORE format.

   *  Significant clean-up of the matrix IO library.

   *  Large rewrite of mcxsubs. It now takes a sane(r) and more
      extendible language for submatrix specifications. Its implementation
      is far less hideous than it used to be.

   *  mcxsubs has --block and --blockc options for taking respectively
      a block diagonal matrix or its complement.  Also, --skin for doing
      manipulations on domains only, and --extend for computing extended
      submatrices.

   *  Added -ax option to MCL, which prints the suffix MCL uses to construct
      the output file name.  This is useful in scripts that depend
      on MCL to create unique (and convenient) filenames. Such as clxcoarse.

   *  Added util scripts clxcoarse and clxdo.
      clxcoarse will currently do 2-level and 3-level clusterings.  clxdo is
      meant to automate simple tasks.  It currently is able to
      - give a granularity count of (presumably) a cluster file.
      - test whether a graph/matrix is undirected/symmetric.
      Both accept the -h option.
         Not yet installed, copy them if needed.

   *  Replaced setenv in src/impala/io.c by putenv. The latter is POSIX,
      the former is not. This caused compilation errors on (some)
      Solaris systems.

   *  Added clmorder which, given a set of input clusterings, computes
      an ordering that tries to put nodes that share many clusters over the
      different clusters nearby, and puts nodes in larger clusters earlier in
      the ordering. It is presumed that the clusterings are successive
      subclusterings, but it need not be strictly the case - clmorder will
      convert the input clusterings to a strictly nested sequence.

         Not yet installed, copy them if needed.
         Not yet documented.

   *  mcxmap has new

         --mapi
         --cmapi
         --rmapi

      options to facilitate use of inverted maps.

   *  mcxmap can map tab files with the -tab <tab-file> option.

   *  Added -my-scheme option to mcl for subtly better default output
      naming capacities. Read the manual for what that means.

   *  Added --lazy-tab to clmformat.

Tue, 9 Nov 2004

   *  mcl-04-314 released, minor fixes.

   *  Some documentation fixes for blast scripts.

   *  Added automatic naming of dumped files.

   *  In automatic output naming, scheme value was not correctly incorporated
      (off by one error).

Mon, 6 Sep 2004

   *  stopgap release: mcl-04-250

   *  mclpipeline/mclblastine used stale mcl options (-do log). Fixed.

   *  Moved doc directory one level higher.

   *  Removed shtest directory.

   *  Moved graph directory one level higher.

   *  Rewrote mcx option parsing, GNU-style now accepted.

   *  mcl-04-230 released.

   *  Fixed bug in the interpretation function. In rare cases (where
      an attractor systems had cardinality exceeding one) it would split
      a cluster.

   *  Fixed some very dumb and slack code in the library.
      100-fold speed increase in mcxsubs block extraction - the slack-bugs
      (slugs?) where *that* slack.

      Sped up applications doing much vector calculus by replacing cute
      initializer-callback-equipped mcxNAlloc invocations with plain mcxAlloc.

   *  Fixed mcxdeblast bug surfacing in the combination of --m9 and
      --tab=<tab-file> options.

   *  64-bit compatibility testing and auditing. Not exhaustive.

   *  Moved doc directory one level higher.

   *  Signal mcl!

      Premature exit of the main iteration (and mcl) can be enforced by
      sending mcl the ALRM signal. It will interpret the last iterand as a
      clustering. This can be useful in the extremely rare case where
      an input graph contains the 3x3 flip-flop state as a subgraph
      (after centering, notably). I recently encountered this when
      clustering a very sparse homology graph (to arrive at orthology)
      using -c 4.

   *  Tentative addition to option parsing. GNU-style equivalence
      of --I=3 and -I 3. Horrors!

         mcl foo.mci --I=3 --scheme=6 --te=8

      thus works. On trial.

   *  Immediately after it has finished a run, mcl can optionally reread
      the input graph, and generate performance characteristics for
      the graph/clustering pair. It can also check whether all clusters
      correspond to connected components in the input graph.

   *  Removed the ugly -do and -dont options.
      Use
         Option                     Default     Previous
         --force-connected=X        0           (new)
         --check-connected=X        0           (new)
         --keep-overlap=X           0           -do keep-overlap
         --append-log=X             1           -do write-log
         --show-log=X               0           -do show-log
         --analyze=X                0           -do clm
      Where X can be any string in 1/y/Y/0/n/N/1.

   *  Added clmclose, for retrieving connected components from a graph,
      and for testing whether the domains in a cluster file or domain file
      correspond to connected components in a given graph.

   *  --apropos output looks better.

Wed, 7 Jul 2004

   *  mcl-04-189 released.

   *  Tim Hughes found a bug in mcxassemble, arising from an embarassing
      typo in the underlying library code - fixed.

   *  Joost van Baal pointed out some issues with the LICENSE.
      It has been reworded to nicely ask scientists to behave properly.

Sat, 3 Jul 2004

   *  mcl-04-185 released.
      Mainly fixes for small glitches and documentation updates, and the new
      general purpose application mcxdump for dumping matrix/tab file
      combinations.  Nothing breathtaking.

   *  Added mcxdump, to do a wider range of dump chores (than clmformat
      already does).

   *  mcl --apropos now dumps one-line descriptions of *all* options,
      even the very obscure and never-use-them options.
      This option will propagate to all siblings in the near future,
      as a result of a rewrite of the option-parsing module.

   *  Updated THANKS; Enter Andreas Kahari (OpenBSD port, compile warnings),
      Jason Stajich (mcxdeblast work), and Tim Hughes (bug reports).

   *  Applied mcxdeblast patchlet by Jason Stajich to support parsing
      WU-BLAST format.

   *  Fixed a bug in the zoem macro definition file output by clmformat,
      reported by Tim Hughes.

   *  The mcxdeblast --m9 option now actually works with the ncbi blast -m 9
      option (i.e. skip comments lines).

   *  Fixed several documentation glitches spotted by Joost van Baal.

   *  Added (somewhat terse and makeshift) remarks on the role of zoem in
      mclpipeline/mclblastline manuals, after Joost pointed out that the
      mclblastline/mclpipeline zoem dependency (via clmformat) was not well
      documented.

Tue, 22 Jun 2004

   *  mcl-04-174 released.

   *  Integrated Jason Stajich's tabular blast format parser.
      Restructured mcxdeblast to a great extent.
      Use --m9 to expect tabular BLAST format.
      With mclblastline, use --blast-m9.

   *  mcxdeblast had its default settings changed to resemble those of
      tribemcl.

   *  mclblastline explicitly uses the mcxassemble '-r max' option; it can be 
      be overruled e.g. by issuing --ass-r=add.

   *  clmformat.zmm: Get rid of spurious braces, update special rules to
      pass evaluation.

   *  NOTE
      mclpipeline was streamlined. All mcl-related options now start with
      --mcl, e.g. --mcl-I=3.0, --mcl-scheme=6, etc. Consult the manual pages if
      needed. All format-related options start with --fmt, all assembly related
      options start with --ass. Any of the --mcl, --ass, --fmt options not
      recognized by mclpipeline will simply be stripped of the prefix and
      passed on to the corresponding program.  To use the clmformat
      --dump-pairs option (which is not in the mclpipeline/mclblastline manual)
      with mclpipeline, use --fmt--dump-pairs.

   *  clmformat acquired the --dump-pairs option, for dumping one cluster/node
      pair per single line.

   *  mcxsubs syntax accepts 3%5 syntax, implying the list 3,8,13,18 and so on.
      The syntax can be repeated, e.g. 3%5,6%13 . Use this for quickly thinning
      out a matrix.  mcxsubs also acquired the options

      -dfac <num>
      -cfac <num>
      -rfac <num>

      --rand-discard
      --rand-merge
      --rand-intersect
      --rand-exclusive

      for randomizing subdomain selection, and

      --spec-cols
      --spec-rows
      --spec-doms

      for omitting the final restriction to subdomains of the input matrix. 
      Refer to the manual page for more information.

      Then, the --reread option was renamed --from-disk.

   *  More jury grades!

Wed, 14 Apr 2004

   *  mcl-04-105 released.

   *  Bumped the gratuitous version tag to 1.004. It has been a long time
      since the previous release and much work has been done.

       - clmformat has gotten a pretty zoem face
       - native binary format was revived and integrated into mcxsubs
            (making it orders of magnitudes faster if binary format is used)
       - the MCL IO library has seen a lot of work
       - the underlying utility libraries have seen much work as well
       - a bug in the loop weight assignment spotted by Abel Ureta-Vidal
            was fixed
       - the mcl '-v clusters' verbosity option is new
       - so is the '-dump dag' option
       - mcxsubs now supports simultaneous extraction of
            (possibly overlapping) blocks
       - the environment variables MCLXASCIIDIGITS,  MCLXIOVERBOSITY,
            MCLXIOFORMAT, and MCLXASCIIFLAGS have arrived
       - mcxarray documentation finally got written
       - and various other fixes for glitches went in, thanks to Joost
            van Baal for some of those

   *  Revived binary format.  Reading matrices is roughly 30 times faster
      in binary format.  For an average MCL run, this may result in a 10% gain
      in speed or more.
      Treat with care; binary format is not portable across some subcollection
      of processors/compilers/filesystems.

      Both binary and ascii input now support reading subgraphs directly
      from disk, which is foremost important for mcxsubs.

   *  mcxsubs is now *much* faster if applied to binary format
      and the --reread option is used. The speed gain may be 400-fold.

   *  Big rewrite of clmformat. All the formatting code was taken out,
      and clmformat now outputs logical formatting statements.
      These are in the zoem language, so for using clmformat one
      needs to install the zoem package, obtainable from

         http://micans.org/zoem/src/zoem-latest.tar.gz

      The good thing is that lay-out can now be changed by editing
      a single zoem macro definition file.

   *  The default of assigning loop weights has changed.
      It is now set to equal the maximum weight found in the list of
      neighbours. The old behaviour can be regained by specifying -cma 100.

      NOTE
         The new default will, with identical inflation value and
      compared with the old default, result in slightly more granular
      (more fine-grained) clusterings. This can optionally
      be compensated for by increasing the inflation value a little.

   *  The new -cma <num> option accepts a number inbetween 0 and 100.
      Think of it as a fraction f expressed as a percentage.  It sets the loop
      value to the weighted average
      
         f * ctr + (1-f) * max

      where ctr is the 'center' of a list of entries (the sum of entries
      squared divided by the squared sum of entries) and max is the maximum
      of that list.

      The loop value thus obtained is multiplied by the value given
      to the -c option (which stands default at 1.0).

   *  Improved interpretation interfaces for overlapping clusterings;
      Added mcl '-dump dag' option, and some changes to clmimac.  Use clmimac
      to interpret matrices obtained either with '-dump ite' or '-dump dag' as
      clusterings. For early mcl iterands, such clusterings may possibly
      contain overlap.

   *  Added mcxarray documentation, it is now installed.

   *  Added clmps utility, which is by default not yet installed and
      has no manpage yet. It outputs the body of a PostScript file.

   *  Added '-v clusters' for reporting on intermediate clusters.
      However, if you are *really* interested in intermediate clusterings,
      you should use '-dump ite' and the clmimac application.

   *  All mcl applications (should) respect the environment variable
      MCLXASCIIDIGITS, setting the number of digits after the decimal point
      that should be written for native ascii format. The special value -1
      indicates that no value should be written at all (upon further reads the
      default value 1.0 will be used). This is relevant only for ascii format.

   *  All mcl applications (should) respect the environment variable
      MCLXIOFORMAT, which regulates whether matrices are written in binary
      or ascii format. Consult the mcl manual page for how it works.

   *  All mcl applications (should) respect the environment variable
      MCLXIOVERBOSITY, which regulates whether a progress bar is printed
      during matrix I/O. Consult the mcl manual page for how it works.

   *  Added 'b:' tag to mcxsubs syntax for retrieving block diagonal matrix
      (where blocks can optionally overlap). Some groundwork in the library
      for enabling this.

   *  Added two more pruning schemes; set the default scheme index
      to four rather than two.

   *  Added mcl -in-gq <val> option, for removing any edges in the
      input graph whose weight is below <val>.

   *  Fixed bug in clminfo (spotted by Abel Ureta-Vidal), causing the
      singleton count to be wrong sometimes.

Fri, 03 Oct 2003

   *  mcl-03-276 released.

   *  added clmmate manual page. Use it to find best pairs of
      clusters between two clusterings (use the -twins option).

   *  fixed mcxmap functional bug.

   *  mcxassemble and mcxdeblast were improved, including fixes and
      suggestions from (at different stages) Abel Ureta-Vidal and
      Dinakarpandian Deendayal.

   *  The documentation now uses the zoem manual NAME macro (recently added),
      so that the troff output is apropos (whatis, man -k) compatible.

   *  fixed trivial bug in mclpipeline.

Tue, 02 Sep 2003

   *  mcl-03-245 released (mainly a maintenance release).

   *  Fixed bug which caused mcl and siblings to crash or go haywire (exit
      for the wrong reaon) when presented with non-conforming input.  The bug
      was introduced during the previous IO module rewrite that brought raw
      matrix format and mcxassemble.  So versions >= 03-154 probably feature
      this bug.

   *  Added mcxarray for creating cosine or pearson matrix from microarray
      data.  Not yet installable, no manpage, -h gives manual.

   *  Added speed/complexity section to mclfaq.

   *  Fixed clmmeet, which appeared to be broken since 03-010.

   *  Added mclgraga, a simple script for granularity gauging. Use as in
      clmformat -icl cluster-fu -dump - | mclgraga --range=0,10,2000 (and in
      other ways as well).  It's not installable though and has no manpage.
      One has to copy it from the source distribution

   *  Changed mclgrep to be not installable; one has to copy it from
      the source distribution. It has no manpage either.

   *  clmformat has -dump <stream>, -pi <infl>, -dump-node-sep <sep> options.

   *  clminfo has -pi <infl>, -ap (append performance measures),
      -ag (append granularity measurs), -do/dont <header|rule>  options.

Fri, 04 Jul 2003

   *  mcl-03-185 released (maintenance release).

   *  Added mclgrep, which can grep sections from an mcl file.
      e.g. 'mclgrep clm foo' will display 'clm' section(s) in the file foo,
      if present. Handy for comparing granularity and performance
      characteristics.

   *  Behold the mcl '-do clm' option; it will include performance criteria
      and granularity characteristics in the cluster output file.

   *  Fixed embarassing clminfo bug (introduced in mcl-03-178).

   *  Fixed mcx broken interactive mode (introduced in mcl-03-178).

Fri, 27 Jun 2003

   *  mcl-03-178 released (maintenance release).

   *  Fixed a bug causing the jury marks, the jury synopsis, and the
      pruning percentages to be wrong.

   *  Added several new features, yet to be documented here
      (documented in the manual pages though).
      Look for the mcl -do and -dont options.

Tue, 03 Jun 2003

   *  mcl-03-154 released.

   *  Encouraged the version number up to 1.003.

   *  Added mcxassemble, clmformat, mclpipeline, mclblastline, mcxdeblast.
      Removed clmconf, its functionality was assimilated by clmformat.

   *  Added -pi <pre-inflation> option to mcl for skewing input weights.

   *  Added automatic output naming facilities to mcl.  By default (if the
      -o option is not used) it will write to out.fname.suf, where fname is the
      name of the input file, and suf is automatically constructed. The -ap and
      -aa options allow further customization.

      For example:
         mcl small.mci -I 3 -c 2.5 -pi 0.8 -scheme 5

      will result in a file named
         out.small.mci.I30s5c25pi08

      It is possible to obtain the file name corresponding with a given run
      by using the -az option.

   *  Removed longtime deprecated -a option.

   *  mclpipeline implements a generic pipeline implementing the
      stages from data file (application-specific input) until
      formatted output (clusters represented in terms of
      application-specific labels).

   *  mclblastline implements a particular mcl pipeline tailored
      to BLAST files.

   *  mcxdeblast added, for parsing BLAST files (beta version).

   *  display results in readable form using clmformat.

   *  Added mcxassemble, which takes as input simple raw cooccurrence
      data in a very free format, and turns it into mcl matrix format.
      Options for adding, maxing, multiplying, and discarding repeated
      entries as well as repeated vectors.

      Nodes can be relabeled by specifying a map file.  This makes it
      easy and fast e.g. to do a one-pass Blast file parse, write the
      cooccurrence data and a prefered node labeling, and then construct
      the final matrix.  The setup for transforming application-specific
      data into raw data is this:

      -  Parse cooccurrence data from some external format.
      -  Transform cooccurrence data to raw mcl data as you parse.
      -  When done, write out required header and domain information
            to a separate file. The domain information can be built during
            the parsing stage.
      -  Use mcxassemble to construct a valid matrix from the raw data
            and the header information.
      -  Nodes can be relabeled as needed using a separate map file,
            which takes the form of a very thin matrix file.

   *  mcxmap uses the new permutation/relabeling mechanism; permutations
      are now fully supported.

   *  IO internals underwent major rewrite in order to support mcxassemble
      raw data munging and mapping functionality (in mcxmap and mcxassemble)

   *  Vector part of impala library was made somewhat safer;
      new mclpAR* type for dealing with multisets of ivps.

   *  # now acts as a comment within the (mclmatrix ... ) section,
      onwards from the begin keyword.

   *  MCL should be straigthforward to compile under Wintel using Cygwin,
      as now verified by SvD (small fix was needed; log2 seems defined
      as macro under cygwin).

   *  clean-ups in underlying util and impala libraries.

   *  implemented
         -DVALUE_AS_DOUBLE and
         -DINDEX_AS_LONG compiler options.
      The first for matrix entries cq edge weights, the second
      for matrix indices cq node identifiers.

   *  revamped
      -DRUNTIME_INTEGRITY compiler option.

   *  clm apps now have --version option.

Fri, 10 Jan 2003

   *  mcl-03-010 released.

      This is a MAJOR overhaul, with increased power in the MCL libraries and
      utilities. The mcl family can now deal with a much more general
      representation of matrices/graphs. This is detailed in several benefits
      listed below. There is a drawback: mcl itself is now approximately 15-20
      percent slower than before (measured on not so large graphs).  Some of
      this loss can perhaps be recouped by forthcoming changes; regardless,
      the benefits were deemed to far outweigh this minor performance loss.

   *  Increased version number to 1.002. The difference between versions
      1.001 and 1.002 is much larger than that between versions 1.001 and
      1.002 - the version numbering scheme is very minimalistic.

   *  mcl's input format was extended (existing graphs are still acceptable).
      See mcx(5) / mcxformat.html.

   *  mcl's internals were rewritten to allow fully sparse matrix/graph
      representation. Formely, the nodes of a graph had to be indexed
      sequentially, starting at zero. This is no longer the case.

      mcl can now internally deal with sparsely indexed graphs.
         Example:
       | (mclheader
       | mcltype matrix
       | dimensions 12x12
       | )
       | (mcldoms
       | 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 123 456 789 $
       | )
       | (mclmatrix
       | begin
       | 11    22  66  77  123 $
       | 22    11  33  55 $
       | 33    22  44  55 $
       | 44    33  88  99 456 $
       | 55    22  33  77  88 $
       | 66    11  123 $
       | 77    11  55  123 $
       | 88    44  55  99 456 $
       | 99    44  88 456 789 $
       | 123   11  66  77 $
       | 456   44  88  99 789 $
       | 789   99 456 $
       | )

      Besides being useful from a user-point of view, this new setup is a
      first step in enabling mcl for grid or cluster computing. 

      Look at the mcx(5) / mcxformat.html page for more information.
      
   *  mcl sibling programs are able to handle clusterings in which the
      clusters have nonconsecutive identifiers.

   *  The low level API is now totally permissive of all kinds of domain
      combinations. It is up to higher levels to enforce domain identity or
      subsumption etc. Also,

      The low level API leaves it up to the caller whether a node is not
      represented because it is not part of the domain or whether it is not
      represented because it has no neighbours.  It is up to the higher levels
      to decide.

      The low level API (and most of the higher level API) allows 0x0, Kx0,
      and 0xK matrices.  mcl will happily cluster a 0x0 graph.

   *  renamed the src/nonema directory to src/impala (permanently).
      renamed src/intalg to src/taurus (tentatively).

   *  renamed mcximac to clmimac.

   *  added mcxmap

   *  added clmresidue

   *  clmdist can now also compute the Jacquard index and the variance of
      information measure (the -mode option). Its output looks nicer and can be
      changed using the -parts, -digits, -width, --nolegend, and --noindex
      options.

   *  The underlying library code for clminfo was thoroughly cleansed.
      An untraced FPEfault was reported for earlier versions; hopefully
      that is now gone.

   *  mcl now accepts
         -sort revsize (default, large clusters first)
         -sort size  (small clusters first)
         -sort lex   (lexicographical ordering)
         -sort none  (clusters as found by interpretation routine)

   *  mcxsubs now
         -  acts on rectangular matrices as well.
         -  can select on value (being >=/> low and/or <=/< high).
         -  can remap the domain of a selected matrix to range 0-N-1,
            for only columns, only rows, or both columns and rows.
         -  can make the selected matrix characteristic.
         -  can transpose the final result.
         -  has fairly horrid looking specification strings.

      It can be used for removing tough nodes from a graph, where toughness is
      measured according to output resulting from running mcl with '-dump
      chr'.

   *  fixed problem with documentation in mcl-02-277.
      verbatim env in html looked rotten under IE.

Fri, 4 Oct 2002

   *  mcl-02-277 released.
      Mostly a maintenance release. Perhaps the extra FAQ entry is most
      noteworthy. Read e.g. http://micans.org/mcl/doc/mclfaq.html#checksymmetry
      A new release featuring support for removal/projection of tough nodes is
      in the pipeline. That release will be more interesting.

   *  Added faq {How do I check that my graph/matrix is symmetric/undirected?}
      Please do check this people!

   *  Several additions and fixes in the util library, nothing much affecting
      mcl.

   *  Added field to '-dump chr' output (loop value before rescaling).

   *  Removed unnecessary 'thou shalt not have values < 0' commandment.

   *  Some small doc additions.

Fri, 21 Jun 2002

   *  mcl-02-172 released.

   *  Fixed --log output format error.

   *  Some autotools fixes, and some changes in documentation generation
      (immaterial for mcl users).

   *  [Joost] configure.ac.in: added AM_MAINTAINER_MODE: by default,
      don't rebuild e.g. Makefile.in from Makefile.am.  Default users are
      not maintainers.

   *  mcl-02-150 released.

   *  Applied valgrind to mcl, and fixed all memory leaks thus found.
      Standard computation paths are clean (if no errors).  Inserted several
      clean-up routines.

   *  Retrofitted this file to include version 02-095.

   *  [Joost] Added acinclude.m4, including acx_pthread.m4 by Steven G.
      Johnson and Alejandro Forero Cuervo, so that we'll build out-of-the-box
      on systems like Tru64Unix/OSF1 which need special compiler flags when
      dealing with pthread stuff.  Thanks to Martin Mokrejs for reporting the
      bug.

   *  Fixed bug present in version 02-095 and 02-116, caused by
      the computation of the average of inhomogeneity over all vectors
      and a very buggy mclVectorMaxValue -- it removes all zero entries from
      vectors. Bug, reported by Martin Mokrejs, manifested itself when
      inhomogeneity was exactly zero for all vectors,

   *  Compiled mcl with checkergcc, and tested a few computation paths.
      No errors found.

   *  [Anton] Updated tribe software after bug report by Maring Mokrejs.

   *  [Joost] Separated Zoem from mcl, modularized util and separated it
      as well. It is still tacked on in the distribution though.

   *  [Joost] Enabled --enable-tribe, the tribe module written by Anton
      Enright.

   *  [Anton] Inserted tribe software.

   *  Removed -dump att option, added more general -dump chr option.

   *  mcl-02-116 released, bumped version number to 1.001.

   *  Added mcximac utility for interpreting MCL iterands as clusterings.

   *  Automated versioning; documents and --version sensitive apps
      now generate consistent date and version tags.

Fri, 05 Apr 2002

   *  mcl-02-095 released.

   *  Added mclfaq document (supported in html, roff, ps).

   *  Added --log option to mcl, appends a log section to
      the clustering output. MUST-DO for large graphs. It is not a default
      because I don't want to scare new users.  This option works with
      --expand-only as well. Logging includes information on kept mass, vector
      footprints, recoveries, selections, and time taken by expansion.

   *  -nw, -nl, -nj, --log, --show-log, -how-much-ram, --jury-charter are new.

   *  Added extensive window monitoring of mass averages for the worst k
      instances, k=1,2,5,10,20,50 .. 20000, 50000.

   *  The mcl -h output is now less frightening, or so I hope.

   *  Added 'jury synopsis' remark classifying the pruning quality.
      It is meant as indication only. Pruning quality is now measured
      in the following flavours:
         perfect exceptional superior excellent good acceptable mediocre poor
      bad lousy miserable awful wretched atrocious

   *  Streamlined command line parsing a lot, using new util/opt.[ch].
      Separated parsing from validation; the framework should be usable for
      setting parameters when calling mcl parts from code.

   *  Modularized the mcl code a lot. It is now close to being
      usable as shared object code with all the command-line functionality
      still accessible.
         moved the lion's part of shmcl/mcl.c to mcl/alg.c. Created
      mcl/alg.[ch], mcl/proc.[ch], mcl/procinit.[ch] mcl/inflate.[ch],
      mcl/expand.[ch], removed mcl/params.[ch] mcl/mcl.[ch].
      shmcl/mcl.c looks acceptable again.

   *  Added util/opt.[ch] util/err.[ch] mcl/init.[ch],
      added mcxHashMerge to util/hash.[ch], streamlined error messages in
      terms of mcxErr, mcxWarn, mcxTell.

   *  Rewrote the mcl manual page so that all pruning-related options
      are now in a separate section.

   *  Documented existing --dense and --thick flags (unlikely
      you need them though).

   *  Cleaned up html documentation a lot. It should now look good in
      most browsers. Moved from <dl> to <table>

   *  Began first ever so slight reworking of taurus. renamed Ilist to mcxIL
      and its 'list' member to 'L'. Terse!

   *  Compiled zoem util mcl shmcl shcl shmcx shmx nonema
      with gcc -pedantic -Wall -ansi, and fixed all the nitty gritty stuff
      thus found, including an erroneous pthread_create argument cast and two
      functions whose declaration was hidden (not in the header file).

Mon, 04 Mar 2002

   *  mcl-02-063 released.

   *  Fixed the missing '#include <string.h>' in taurus/ilist.c,
      and fixed the bug caused by #defining TRUE and FALSE without
      checking whether they were previously defined.

Wed, 27 Feb 2002
   
   *  mcl-02-058 released.

   *  Mcl-related changes are all updates in the documentation,
      plus small changes in the underlying 'util' library.  No functional
      changes.

   *  Zoem has changed significantly since the previous release.
      It needs to be separated from mcl.  (zoem is the tool with which mcl
      documentation is generated).

Fri, 15 Feb 2002

   *  mcl-02-047 released.

Tue,  5 Feb 2002

   *  mcl-02-035 released.

Wed, 12 Dec 2001

   *  mcl-20011211 released.
